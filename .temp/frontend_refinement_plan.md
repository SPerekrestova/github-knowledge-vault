# Frontend Refinement Plan

## Overview of Current State

The project is a React + TypeScript application using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for the frontend. It has a component-based structure with separate directories for components, pages, hooks, utilities, and types. The current UI provides core functionality for displaying and filtering knowledge base content from GitHub.

## Overview of the Final State

The goal is to refine the existing frontend to visually match the style and layout of the example website (https://knowledge-base-generator-2-nestor-demo.vybe.build/). This involves updating the overall layout, color scheme, typography, component styling (e.g., navigation, lists, content display), and ensuring a consistent look and feel across the application.

## List of Files/Directories to Change

*   `src/components/`: Update the styling and structure of UI components like navigation, filters, content lists, and modals to match the example.
*   `src/pages/`: Refine the layout and arrangement of components on different pages.
*   `src/index.css`, `src/App.css`: Modify global styles, typography, and potentially color variables.
*   `tailwind.config.ts`: Adjust Tailwind configuration, including colors, spacing, and other design tokens, to align with the example's theme.
*   `src/lib/utils.ts` (or similar): Potentially add or modify utility functions related to styling or layout if necessary.
